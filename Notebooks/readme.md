## üìÅ Notebook Overview

| No. | Notebook Name | Description |
|:---:|:----------------------------|:----------------------------|
| **1** | `1. Inferencing on test data.ipynb` | Performs inference on the provided test dataset using the trained multi-label model. Outputs predictions ready for submission to Kaggle. |
| **2** | `2. Inferencing on a single image.ipynb` | Used for quick evaluation or debugging. Runs inference on a single quadrat image to visualize model performance and predicted species. |
| **3** | `3. Introduction to Tiling.ipynb` | Demonstrates the tiling concept used to handle large quadrat images by dividing them into smaller patches for efficient model inference. |
| **4** | `4. Tiling Techniques.ipynb` | Implements the initial version of the tiling pipeline with image segmentation, patch extraction, and visualization. |
| **5** | `5. Aggregation Techniques.ipynb` | Combines predictions from multiple tiles or models to produce a single aggregated prediction per quadrat image (ensemble/post-processing). |
| **6** | `6. Tiling Inference ‚Äì Post Aggregation.ipynb` | Demonstrates the full inference workflow with tiling and aggregation combined for improved final accuracy. |
| **7** | `7. Final Prediction.ipynb` | Complete workflow leading to the final prediction. |
| **8** | `8. Model Architecture.ipynb` | Defines and visualizes the deep learning architecture used for the task (DINO). Includes model summary and parameter tuning steps. |
